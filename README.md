## Art Ecommerce Website - Milestone Project 4

[View the Live Website Here](https://jhroche-young-irish-artists.herokuapp.com/)

This project comprises the development of a fictional ecommerce website where users can purchase prints by exciting new artists based in Ireland working in a range of painting styles. The website also provides a helpful platform for recently graduated artists to gain exposure and recognition of their recent work. The website allows the user to create a profile when they are making a purchase so that they have an account through which they can see their history of purchases and load their information in order to make future orders easier. There is also a super user profile through which products can be amended through CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) features. In respect of the overall construction of this website, it has been designed to be fully responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of media devices (e.g. mobile, tablet and desktop), in order to make it as easy as possible for users of the website to navigate it and make their required purchases.

## User Experience 

### User Stories

### First Time Visitor Goals
1.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to quickly confirm what products the ecommerce website is selling (e.g. art prints).
2.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily browse through the site pages (including About and Artists) and view the artworks that are on offer.
3.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to go to the Register page and create my own account if I am considering making a purchase.

### Returning Visitor Goals
1.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to be able to make purchases of art prints easily and effortlessly, as I have an account and my information will be pre-loaded to save me time. 
2.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to filter my searches for artworks by genre, price, rating or specials, in order that I can purchase the artworks that best suit my taste and price range. 

### Frequent Visitor Goals
1. As a Frequent/Returning Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact Young Irish Artists if there has been any issue with my purchase, and the contact information is clearly highlighted in the Footer Section of the site. 
2. As a Frequent/Returning Visitor, I want to be able to see new artists that have joined the site and the new artworks that they have produced, as the artworks on offer will be updated on a regular basis.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
- In designing the colour scheme for this website, I focused upon using various white, black and green colours, while the buttons and toasts used a variety of colours (including blue, yellow and red) for hover, focus and active states. I ensured that these colours contrasted well in respect of the overall styling and would result in good readability and accessibility for the user, which I confirmed was in order through completing detailed testing on Google Lighthouse.

- The main colours that I used for the website are detailed in the colour chart below which I prepared on coolors.co;

### Typography
- The Roboto font (which I downloaded from Google Fonts) is the main font used throughout the 
whole website, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the Roboto font fails to be 
imported correctly.
- As per its description on the Google Fonts website, Roboto has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric, while at the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. It was designed by Christian Robertson, an interface designer at Google. 

### Imagery
- The imagery within the website is very focused upon the artworks that the site is selling. The home page has a large background image featuring a very colourful oil painting on a white canvas, which immediately captures the attention of the user. The About and Artists pages feature cards with images of the management team of Young Irish Artists and the artists represented in the site, and these give the user a visual representation of who these people are. The artworks page itself includes cards with images of the artworks so users can choose the style and design of what they wish to purchase, and there is a feature where the user can click into the artwork to see a full screen image and study it more carefully. Examples of images from the site are detailed below;

### Wireframes
- My general site map and wireframes are saved to PDF and can be found [here](media/wireframes.pdf). I designed them at the start of the project and they served as the basis for this project.
