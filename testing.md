- Responsiveness: The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, iPad and iPhone6. All formats were in order with no sections out of line or overlapping.

- I completed a large amount of detailed testing to ensure that all links and email functionality were working correctly and that external links opened (as detailed in Manual Testing section above), and was happy that there were no broken links. This involved going into every page of the site and clicking every link/button that is available to a user (as part of their journey through the site) to ensure that everything was fully functional. 

- I checked the console in Devtools and confirmed that there were no error reports in respect of any of the pages.

- As part of the testing process, my family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs
- N/A - No bugs were found during the testing completed before submission.
